## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates modern web development practices for building a responsive, multi-section landing page. It features a sleek design, smooth carousel animations, hover effects, and a mobile-first approach ensuring perfect rendering across all device sizes (Desktops, Tablets, and Mobile phones).

## ✨ Features
- **Responsive Navigation**: A collapsible navbar that adapts seamlessly to mobile screens.
- **Hero Carousel**: An elegant image slider with overlaid text and calls-to-action using Bootstrap's Carousel component.
- **Dynamic Grid Layouts**: Utilizes Bootstrap's grid system for structuring features, team members, and pricing plans.
- **Interactive Forms**: Clean and functional UI for user sign-ups, login, and contact messaging.
- **Pricing Cards**: A modern flexbox/grid layout for subscription plans.
- **Google Fonts Integration**: Uses visually appealing typography ('Poppins' font family).
- **Custom SCSS/CSS Styling**: Enhances Bootstrap's default styles with custom colors, gradients, and custom components.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structural markup.
- **Bootstrap 5.3.8**: For robust, responsive grid layout and pre-built UI components (Navbars, Carousels, Cards).
- **CSS3 / SCSS**: For custom styling, animations, and overriding Bootstrap variables.
- **JavaScript (Bootstrap Bundle)**: For handling interactive components like carousels and mobile menus.
